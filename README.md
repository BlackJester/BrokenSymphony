# BrokenSymphony
a project of my Game Engineering education. It is a VR rhythm game where the player has to enchant his enemies in tact of the music. I was responsible to implement the rhythm tick event, which sends a trigger to all objects, which should act on the beat. Furthermore i implemented the whole enemy behaviour.
